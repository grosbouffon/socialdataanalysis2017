    "Today we make a **major shift** in the direction of the course. We will leave the machine learning behind and start working seriously on the visualization. Each of the last three lectures, we will have two main topics\n",
    "\n",
    "* We start with a couple of short lectures on the principles of visualization - why do we need data visualization and what can we do with it. \n",
    "* Then we work with our second text book [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345), which is essentially one long tutorial for learning `D3.js`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may ask: \"What? We've just learned Python, and now you want us to learn yet another programming language! Why???\". The answer is that you there is no way around D3 if you're serious about visualizing data. D3 stands for \"Data Driven Documents\" and is the right way to create interactive data visualization in the browser. Have a look at the examples below to get a sense of why D3 is the _de facto_ standard for serious data visualization on the web:\n",
